APAD Project - Phase 3 Description

1.1 A Mobile App Interface

The goal of this phase is to write an Android App that allows a user to access the functionality we implemented in phases 1 and 2. Only a subset of th feature implemented in phase 2 are currently available in the App interface. Specifically, as the user of the App is not an admin, we have only implemented the features associated with the user’s interaction.

All of the features from phase 2 are still functional from the web interface. 

App Features:

1. Account management:
  • Create an account
  • Login into an account
  • Logout from an account
  
2. App related functions 
  • Search for events
  • Join an event
  • Show events the user has currently joined in

Project Documentation is available at http://apad-project2.appspot.com/info) 

The site provides the following details about our project:
1. The narrative for our project
2. A howto for the web interface with screenshots
3. A howto for the App interface with screenshots
4. A download button to allow a visitor to download the App
5. An “about” page with a brief description of what the app does and who the team members are.
