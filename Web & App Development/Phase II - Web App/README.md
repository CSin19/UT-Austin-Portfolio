APAD Phase 2 - Project Description 

1.1 Web Deployment

The goes of this phase is to deploy our app on the web so users can access it using a Browser. This entails:
1. Getting the site to be publicly available using Google App Engine (GAE) http://apad-project2.appspot.com
2. Writing the python script that will handle http requests.
3. Using SQL-based database called Google Cloud SQL 

1.2 Browser UI

Provide a simple UI to access the features that we worked out in Phase 1. For example, there are two “routes” that the app provides:

1. http://apad-project2.appspot.com/: Allows users to:
• Create an account
• Login into an account
• Search for events
• Join an event
• Show events the user has currently joined in

2. http://apad-project2.appspot.com/admin: Allows an admin user to:
• Login into the admin account • Add/Delete a new venue
• Delete a Event
• Delete a User
